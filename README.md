# SQL-for-Marketing: Querying a Marketing Campaign dataset for Customer Segmentation

This EDA project seeks to gain insights on the customers' purchasing behaviours and patterns, and also answer the following questions:
• What are the 'best' and 'worst' customer groups?
• What do the customers in these groups have in common?
• Which marketing campaigns got the highest number of acceptance offers, and which got the lowest?
• How do the customers' income, education and relationship status affect their purchasing power?

This project is beneficial to everyone who’s interested in Marketing/Web Analytics, Product Analytics or looking to work in the retail or ecommerce sector and areas dealing with Customer Analytics.

Here's a preview of the project on SQL Server:
